 *
 *  Every cascade task, target and camera is kept. Only casters that left the set, changed their cascade cap, or cast
 *  through a stale no-colour view are dropped, in one pass per task; unchanged casters keep their resolved packets. The
 *  dropped casters that are still in the set are queued again: through a fresh view when theirs was stale, and through
 *  the cached view of their material when only their cap changed. A view is stale when the caster's material was
 *  rebuilt (`_csmGen`) or re-pointed (`setShadowCasterMaterial`) since the snapshot, or when its material is missing
 *  from it: the caster switched material or got its first one, or it joins with an unseen material, whose chain may
 *  hold a view another caster's chain cached before the terminal was rebuilt.
 *
 *  A changed caster whose view cannot be built yet (`holdCsmCaster`) is held instead, without holding back any other
 *  caster: it leaves every task once, its packets retired behind the frame fence, since they may reference per-mesh
 *  resources retired with its previous material, possibly in a frame this reconcile did not see (the generator was
 *  parked). A registered one keeps its cap entry, and its material is not snapshotted, so it still reads as changed and
 *  is requeued through a fresh view once the hold lifts, or rejoins if its change is reverted. A caster without a
 *  material and without a packet (one held before, one that never joined, or one re-capped without a material, whose
 *  packets are dropped then) waits the same way until a material is assigned. The hold is decided per material, so
 *  every caster of a held material waits: queueing a new one would snapshot the material, and a registered caster
 *  sharing it would then never be requeued. The held casters are kept as `_held`; while they are unchanged, the same
 *  caster array with no stale material returns at once, so an unresolved hold costs a scan and no task. A hold that
 *  lifts or changes runs the reconcile again, also when no scene version moves (a view factory import lands, a change
 *  is reverted).
 *
 *  Nothing is resolved here: when a caster was queued, the shadow scheduler records each cascade once (forced through
 *  `_recordedVersion`), so K requeued casters cost one transaction per cascade instead of one whole-task rebind per
 *  caster. A drop alone needs no record, only a redraw. When a caster was dropped or queued, the material snapshots and
 *  views are pruned to what the live casters reach, and the dropped casters (possibly none) are returned so a caller
 *  with more tasks can update them too; a new array with the same members, caps and unchanged materials, also while a
 *  caster stays held, is only adopted: no task or bundle is touched, and undefined is returned. */
